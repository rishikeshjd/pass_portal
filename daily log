# Rishikesh Spacecraft Scheduler - Full Progress Report (Sep 4, 2025)
---
## Project Setup and File Structure Exploration
- Explored frontend React structure; key folders: `src/layouts/dashboard`, `components`, `context`, etc.
- Frontend `package.json` contains React scripts including `"start": "react-scripts start"`.

## Initial Problem: Frontend Runtime Errors & Backend Proxy Failure
- Frontend runtime error: `functions is undefined` in `MDTypographyRoot.js`.
- Proxy errors: frontend unable to reach backend at `localhost:8080` because backend was not running.

## Backend Investigation & Startup
- Backend located in `rishikesh-spacecraft-scheduler/backend`.
- No `"start"` script in backend `package.json`, `npm start` failed.
- Manually started backend using:  
  ```bash
  node src/index.js

Backend successfully running on port 8080.

Frontend Configuration & Proxy
Frontend package.json has proxy "proxy": "http://localhost:8080/".
Proxy errors stopped once backend was running.
Debugging Frontend Runtime Error
Error caused by missing functions in theme object (used for linearGradient).
Fixed by correcting theme configuration to include functions.
Restarted frontend; error resolved.
Dependency Management Issues
Tried installing missing babel plugin dependency:

Welcome to PassPortal
This is your new dashboard. We’ll make it beautiful soon.

Frontend and backend communicate successfully.

Commands Used (Chronological)
cd src/layouts/dashboard
ls
cd ../..
cd backend/src
ls
cd ../..
npm install
npm start  # failed
cd backend/src
node index.js  # backend running
cd frontend
npm start  # frontend started, proxy errors initially
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object  # permission error
# Fixed theme file in src/components/MDTypography/MDTypographyRoot.js
npm start  # restarted frontend



Key Observations & Notes
Backend requires "start" script for convenience.
Frontend proxy works when backend is running.
Theme config must provide utility functions to avoid runtime errors.
NPM permission issues need resolution.


Next Steps

Backend
Add "start": "node src/index.js" to backend package.json.
Add logging, error handling, health checks.
Implement missing API routes and Dockerize backend.

Frontend
Confirm theme includes all utilities (functions, gradients).
Wrap app with ThemeProvider properly.
Improve error handling and loading states.
Begin UI redesign for professional look.
Consider migrating off CRA if needed.

Development Environment
Fix npm registry/permission issues.

Document startup instructions.
Use concurrently to run backend/frontend together.
Testing & Deployment
Write backend unit tests.
Add frontend component tests.
Set up CI/CD pipelines.
Deploy staging environment for QA.





Summary
Resolved frontend-backend connection issues by manually starting backend and fixing theme.
Application now runs end-to-end locally with basic dashboard UI.
NPM permission warnings remain to be addressed.
Ready to move forward with UI/UX enhancements and backend improvements.

=== DETAILED SUMMARY REPORT (Post-Break Work) ===

1. Frontend Progress and Setup
- You confirmed wanting to finish frontend work.
- Requested simple step-by-step instructions to proceed.
- Provided complete, simplified React `index.js` code for frontend.
- You saved it and asked what’s next.

2. Backend and Routing Clarifications
- Explained folder structure in backend (routes folder with multiple files).
- You shared your current backend `index.js` code handling `/send-request`.
- Requested complete backend `index.js` to replace with a working version.
- Provided a full, clean backend `index.js` with:
  - Express app setup on port 8080
  - Middleware for JSON parsing
  - POST `/send-request` route writing requests to file
  - Added new `/api/dashboard-stats` GET route returning dummy stats
  - Connected a `scheduleRouter` for `/api` prefixed routes

3. Data File Handling and Placement
- You mentioned having a critical sample data file `data.json`.
- Shared its contents (spacecraft schedule data with fields like `id`, `date`, `sc`, `stn`, `orb`, `ele`, `aos`, `los`, `oprn`).
- You confirmed there are thousands of similar data samples for simulation.
- You asked how to make sure `data.json` is in backend folder.
- Guided you through locating backend folder and copying `data.json` into it:
  - Corrected your path mistakes for copy command.
  - Confirmed successful copying of `data.json` into backend folder.

4. Backend Schedule API Setup
- Explained the need for backend `/api/schedule` route serving the schedule data.
- You showed your attempt to use `scheduleRouter` in backend.
- I provided full backend `index.js` code incorporating the `scheduleRouter`.
- You replaced your backend `index.js` with the new code.

5. Server Running and Errors
- On starting backend, got `EADDRINUSE` error (port 8080 in use).
- Explained how to identify and kill the process using port 8080.
- You managed to kill conflicting process and restart server successfully.
- Later, faced a module load error due to wrong path (`src/src/index.js`).
- Corrected the command to run backend from correct folder.
- Server started successfully and logs “Server listening to port 8080”.

6. Frontend Testing and API Troubleshooting
- Your frontend displayed “Welcome to PassPortal Dashboard” but showed “Failed to load schedule” error.
- You tested backend API with curl `http://localhost:8080/api/schedule`.
- Backend responded with error: `{"error":"Failed to load schedule data"}`.
- This means the backend schedule route failed to read or serve `data.json`.
- You planned to take a break here.

---

**Summary of Immediate Next Steps:**

1. Fix backend `/api/schedule` route:
   - Ensure it correctly reads `data.json` file from backend folder.
   - Send proper JSON response or appropriate error messages.

2. Test backend schedule endpoint again with curl.

3. Confirm frontend successfully fetches and displays schedule data using `<ScheduleTable />` component.

4. Once schedule data loads in frontend, move on to styling and improving UI.

Priority: Develop the frontend application as soon as possible.  
The frontend development is the top priority and should be completed before moving on to any other tasks.  
Focus all efforts on implementing and finalizing the frontend features, UI, and data integration with the backend APIs without delay.
