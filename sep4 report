# Rishikesh Spacecraft Scheduler - Full Progress Report (Sep 4, 2025)
---
## Project Setup and File Structure Exploration
- Explored frontend React structure; key folders: `src/layouts/dashboard`, `components`, `context`, etc.
- Frontend `package.json` contains React scripts including `"start": "react-scripts start"`.

## Initial Problem: Frontend Runtime Errors & Backend Proxy Failure
- Frontend runtime error: `functions is undefined` in `MDTypographyRoot.js`.
- Proxy errors: frontend unable to reach backend at `localhost:8080` because backend was not running.

## Backend Investigation & Startup
- Backend located in `rishikesh-spacecraft-scheduler/backend`.
- No `"start"` script in backend `package.json`, `npm start` failed.
- Manually started backend using:  
  ```bash
  node src/index.js

Backend successfully running on port 8080.

Frontend Configuration & Proxy
Frontend package.json has proxy "proxy": "http://localhost:8080/".
Proxy errors stopped once backend was running.
Debugging Frontend Runtime Error
Error caused by missing functions in theme object (used for linearGradient).
Fixed by correcting theme configuration to include functions.
Restarted frontend; error resolved.
Dependency Management Issues
Tried installing missing babel plugin dependency:

Welcome to PassPortal
This is your new dashboard. Weâ€™ll make it beautiful soon.

Frontend and backend communicate successfully.

Commands Used (Chronological)
cd src/layouts/dashboard
ls
cd ../..
cd backend/src
ls
cd ../..
npm install
npm start  # failed
cd backend/src
node index.js  # backend running
cd frontend
npm start  # frontend started, proxy errors initially
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object  # permission error
# Fixed theme file in src/components/MDTypography/MDTypographyRoot.js
npm start  # restarted frontend



Key Observations & Notes
Backend requires "start" script for convenience.
Frontend proxy works when backend is running.
Theme config must provide utility functions to avoid runtime errors.
NPM permission issues need resolution.


Next Steps

Backend
Add "start": "node src/index.js" to backend package.json.
Add logging, error handling, health checks.
Implement missing API routes and Dockerize backend.

Frontend
Confirm theme includes all utilities (functions, gradients).
Wrap app with ThemeProvider properly.
Improve error handling and loading states.
Begin UI redesign for professional look.
Consider migrating off CRA if needed.

Development Environment
Fix npm registry/permission issues.

Document startup instructions.
Use concurrently to run backend/frontend together.
Testing & Deployment
Write backend unit tests.
Add frontend component tests.
Set up CI/CD pipelines.
Deploy staging environment for QA.





Summary
Resolved frontend-backend connection issues by manually starting backend and fixing theme.
Application now runs end-to-end locally with basic dashboard UI.
NPM permission warnings remain to be addressed.
Ready to move forward with UI/UX enhancements and backend improvements.
