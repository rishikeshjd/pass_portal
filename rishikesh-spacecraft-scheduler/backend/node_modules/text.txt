The node_modules folder is a special directory in Node.js projects that stores all the third-party packages and dependencies your project requires. When you install packages using npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn, these tools download the relevant code and place it inside node_modules. This folder includes both the packages you explicitly added and their nested dependencies.

Key points about node_modules:

    Purpose: It contains all the external libraries your project relies on to work. This allows you to use code created by others without including it in your repository manually.

    Generated Automatically: You should never manually edit or copy files into node_modules. Instead, you maintain your dependencies in your package.json and package-lock.json files. Running npm install reads these files and recreates your node_modules folder exactly.

    Large Size & Exclusion from Git: The folder can become very large since it contains many files and libraries. For this reason, it's standard practice to add node_modules/ to your .gitignore file so that it is not included in your Git repository. This keeps your repo lightweight.

    Reproducibility: Other developers or deployment environments clone your repository and simply run npm install. This installs the exact dependencies and versions as defined in package-lock.json directly into a fresh node_modules folder.

    Project Isolation: Each Node.js project has its own node_modules. This ensures dependencies are kept isolated, avoiding version conflicts and providing better modularity.

    Do Not Share node_modules: Copying or sharing your node_modules folder between projects or environments is discouraged because dependencies might differ in version, platform compatibility, or configuration.

In short:
Create the node_modules folder by running npm install.
Do not manually add or commit node_modules to GitHub. Use .gitignore to exclude it.
Rely on package.json and package-lock.json for consistent dependency management.
